This project is a simple, single-page website created using HTML and CSS. Its primary purpose is to provide a straightforward introduction and definition of HyperText Markup Language (HTML) and Cascading Style Sheets (CSS).

The site's layout is built using modern CSS, specifically a grid for the overall structure and a flex container for the navigation bar, demonstrating fundamental web design principles. Visitors can navigate the site to learn about HTML and CSS and find contact information. This serves as a foundational example of how to structure content and apply styling to a web page.
